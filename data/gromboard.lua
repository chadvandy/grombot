For context, historical battles are custom-made scripted battles that you can play, similar to Quest Battles from Warhammer. When you choose a battle, there's a sliding bar for difficulty from Easy to Legendary.
I want to make it so the difficulty you choose affects the units that spawn. I imagine this requires a read condition of what difficulty is selected, and then it'll load a specific script. I just need a hand setting up this read condition. Cheers.]=],
