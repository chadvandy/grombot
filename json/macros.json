This means creating the unit text (ie. \"Dreadspears\") that shows up within the game's UI (ie. within the unit tooltip). Localisation is done within *.loc files, located within the directory *.pack/text/. Loc files are loaded from lowest alphanumerical priority (zzzz) to highest alphanumerical priority (!!!!). To overwrite existing text in the game, your .loc file has to be a higher priority than the .loc file name you're overriding.\n\nWithin the .loc file, there's three columns - key, text, and a boolean that DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL. The \"key\" uses a simple structure - `[table name]_[column name]_[key]`. In db tables, there will be some columns that don't do anything *within* the DB, and have to be done in .loc. An easy example is, within land_units, there's an \"onscreen_name\" column that's visible within the Assembly Kit. If you create a new unit with the key \"my_awesome_unit\", the loc key would be: `land_units_onscreen_name_my_awesome_unit`. The \"text\" column would be the in-game text you want: \"My Awesome Unit!\"\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597937992773926962/929367264518623232/Untitled.png\n\nAdditionally, RPFM can generate missing loc entries for you.

This is where stuff that really affects the game will be located. Notably, the \"Episodic Scripting\" page in the Campaign Index is the place that has pretty much every edit-game function, like \"spawn army\" or \"add experience\".\n- Script Pages refers to pure Lua scripts in the vanilla game. It'll basically just tell you how things work - like the Invasion Manager, or whatever Lua-based thing you want to use.\n\nSome important fun facts:\n- If you're trying to get to the Model Hierarchy, to find stuff about events/listeners/game interfaces, go to Campaign Index and click \"Model Hierarchy\" at the top center of the page. Use `?macro Scripting Events` to read more about how to use this!\n- For campaign functions, check \"Campaign Manager\" and \"Episodic Scripting\". If some function is present in both, *use the Campaign Manager version*.\n- You can use the search bar to find some shtuff, like typing in \"unit\" to find the command \"remove_unit_from_character\".","creation_time":0,"user":"","tags":{"scripting":true},"name":"Script Docs","num_uses":7},"Disable pings":{"ticket_num":50,"field":"Please disable pings when quoting and it's not an urgent matter.
